# Testing day application stub

* [Assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_N8WLocdokIcb6KhfmqLUcMkvevoOqmHFRRDBA3MUzw/edit#)



Notes on limitations:

* Postgres must be started through docker-compose.yaml manually before running the mvn clean install with tests
* Fixer API not mocked - calls the data provider directly
